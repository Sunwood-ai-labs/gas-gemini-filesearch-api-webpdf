A soft polymer clay cloud dragon figurine with rounded, childlike proportions — large head, small body, friendly handmade texture. Its wings and scales blend shades of sky blue and milky white, symbolizing fluid data movement. Gentle, even lighting in an off-white space reveals subtle matte texture.
Add elegant serif text “gas gemini filesearch api webpdf - v0.1.0 -” beneath the figure, balanced like a design catalog layout.
